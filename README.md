# About Community bot
A discord bot that anyone can modify and commit to! I want it to be as open-source as possible, so feel free to work on any feature you like!

## Features
You can invite the bot to your server by clicking [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=610225885093691467&scope=bot&permissions=8).
A feature list is available in the [help file](https://github.com/IpProxyNeon/Community-discord-bot/blob/master/help.txt)!
You can check out the bot by joining [this Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zF8z7ar) too!

## Programming languages
You can use any programming language but preferably NodeJS or Python as I use Python the most, and I can understand NodeJS a bit, but any language is fine (Even C)! 

## Note
People who want to run an instance of this bot themselves, this was made for a Linux system (Debian specifically), so please don't complain and say "This bot is broken!" or "This bot is trash", it was made for a Linux OS in mind, although, if it worked for someone on a Windows machine, that'd be cool!
Contributors, please put your name by the feature you have added, It would be easier to contact the creator for a certain command if it breaks ToS or something, Also make sure you join the community discord so you can help people

For people looking to use this bot, Most of the features aren't on GitHub yet until they are rewritten properly, which I am working on.
