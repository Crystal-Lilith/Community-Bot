# About Community bot
A discord bot that anyone can modify and commit to! I want it to be as open-source as possible, so feel free to work on any feature you like!

## Features
You can invite the bot to your server by clicking [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=610225885093691467&scope=bot&permissions=8).
A feature list is available in the [help file](https://github.com/IpProxyNeon/Community-discord-bot/blob/master/help.txt)!
You can check out the bot by joining [this Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gyHvBXS) too!

## Programming languages
You can commit in CoffeeScript and JavaScript.

## Note
People who want to run an instance of this bot, if you are using a Linux system, you are able to use the 'system' cog

Windows users, please use the `shell`, and make sure you use windows 10, otherwise some commands from the `system` cog might not work

Contributors, please put your name by the feature you have added, It would be easier to contact the creator for a certain command if it breaks ToS or something, Also make sure you join the community discord so you can help people.
Dont Forget To Download the repo!
