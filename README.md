# Community-discord-bot
A discord bot that anyone can modify and commit to!

# Features
Check the current features of the bot by inviting it https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=610225885093691467&scope=bot&permissions=8
Now has music commands!

# Programming languages
You can use any programming language but preferably NodeJS, Java or Python

# Note
Devs, Please put your name by the feature you have added, It would be easier to contact the creator for a certain command if it breaks ToS or something, Also make sure you join the community discord so you can help people, just do /support.
Also if you can recreate the current features (/help) please do so, it would be amazing since I have to watch ads to keep the bot going right now.
