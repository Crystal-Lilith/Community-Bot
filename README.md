# Community-discord-bot
A discord bot that anyone can modify and commit to!

# Features
Check the current features of the bot by inviting it https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=610225885093691467&scope=bot&permissions=8
The discord server for the bot: https://discord.gg/zF8z7ar

Now has music commands

# Programming languages
You can use any programming language but preferably NodeJS, Java or Python

# Note
Anyone running your own instance of this bot, make sure you rename 'sample-config.txt' to 'config.txt', 'sample-token.txt` to 'token.txt' (With your token edited in both of them) and 'sample-CIDs.json' to 'CIDs.json' (Must do this or it will error out!)
Devs, Please put your name by the feature you have added, It would be easier to contact the creator for a certain command if it breaks ToS or something, Also make sure you join the community discord so you can help people, just do /support.
Also if you can recreate the current features (/help) please do so, it would be amazing since I have to watch ads to keep the bot going right now. When you upload your command, make sure it gets the token from token.txt for convenience.

For people looking to use this bot, Most of the features aren't on GitHub yet until they are remade in actual code, which I am working on.
